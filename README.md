# Serializable Trie

>A ready to use *Java* library for the **Trie** data structure with support for **serialization** and 
**deserialization**

 #### This library supports the following features
 
* Initialize a trie by passing the absolute file path or by passing a list of strings
* Initialize an empty trie
* Insert a single word into the trie
* Delete a single word from the trie
* This library supports multiple occurrences of the same word
* Validate if a word is present in the trie
* Count number of occurrences of a word
* Fetch all unique words present in the trie
* Serialize: Convert the string into a string representation
* Deserialize: Construct a trie from supported serialized string format

> Note: This library does not support alphanumeric strings and use of the characters '<' and '>' in the string.
